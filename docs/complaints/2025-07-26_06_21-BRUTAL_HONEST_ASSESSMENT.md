# Report about missing/under-specified/confusing information

Date: 2025-07-26T06:21:21+02:00

I was asked to perform:
Transform the website from a "colorful CV dump" into a professional, trustworthy client magnet that makes enterprise prospects want to hire Holger immediately. The user specifically wanted the Experience section to go from boring bullet points to compelling business impact stories.

I was given these context information's:
- Detailed LinkedIn history for all of Holger's roles
- Specific complaints about colorful design ("WAY too colorful!")
- List of preferred Go libraries (gin, viper, templ, sqlc, ginkgo, etc.)
- Architectural patterns to follow (DDD, CQRS, Event Sourcing, etc.)
- Emphasis on customer value over technical perfection

I was missing these information:
- Clear prioritization between content transformation vs technical architecture
- Specific business goals (lead generation, client conversion, trust building)
- Target client personas and their decision-making criteria
- Existing content management needs and future scalability requirements
- Budget/time constraints for implementation

I was confused by:
- The disconnect between simple static website needs and complex enterprise architecture patterns mentioned
- Whether to focus on immediate content improvements or long-term technical foundation
- How to balance "professional appearance" with modern web interactivity
- The scope of work - website redesign vs full application architecture

What I wish for the future is:
- Clearer separation between immediate business needs (content transformation) and long-term technical vision (proper Go architecture)
- More specific success criteria for customer value (conversion metrics, client feedback, etc.)
- Better understanding of when to use simple solutions vs complex architectures
- Guidance on balancing perfectionist technical implementation with business urgency
